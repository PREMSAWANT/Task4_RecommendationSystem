## 📌 Task 4: Book Recommender System – Collaborative Filtering in Java

### 📝 Description of the Task:

This task focused on building a book recommender system based on user preferences. Users rate a set of books, and the system provides personalized recommendations by comparing their ratings with other users.

It uses a simple collaborative filtering logic to identify similar users and suggest books they liked but which the current user hasn’t rated.

---

### 💡 What I Learned:

- Working with nested HashMaps and Lists
- Collaborative filtering logic: user similarity and item suggestion
- Console UI interaction and persistent user sessions
- Filtering logic to match user behavior

---

### 🛠 Technologies Used:

- Java Core (`java.util`)
- HashMap, List, Scanner

---

### 🔍 Features Implemented:

1. Rating system: rate any book from a list of 5
2. Recommendations: suggest books rated 4+ by similar users
3. View personal rating history
4. Input validation and friendly feedback

---

### ✅ Conclusion:

This project helped me understand how basic AI-like recommendation systems work. It demonstrated the power of using basic logic and data structures in building intelligent systems without any external tools.
